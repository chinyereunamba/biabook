## Database Configuration

BookMe supports both local SQLite databases and remote LibSQL databases via Turso:

### Local Development (SQLite)

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=""  # Leave empty for local SQLite
```

### Production (Turso/LibSQL)

```env
DATABASE_URL="libsql://your-database-url.turso.io"
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN="your-turso-auth-token"
```

The database connection is configured in `src/server/db/index.ts` using the `@libsql/client` with automatic environment variable detection. The system uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and migrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biabook.git
   cd bookme
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update the `.env` file with your credentials:

   ```env
   # Authentication
   AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret"
   AUTH_GOOGLE_ID="your-google-oauth-client-id"
   AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET="your-google-oauth-client-secret"

   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"  # For local development
   # DATABASE_URL="libsql://your-turso-database-url"  # For production with Turso
   DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=""  # Required for Turso, leave empty for local SQLite

   # Email Service (SMTP)
   EMAIL_FROM="your-email@domain.com"
   EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
   EMAIL_SERVER_PORT="587"
   EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-email-username"
   EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"

   # WhatsApp Business API
   WHATSAPP_API_URL="https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0"
   WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID="your-phone-number-id"
   WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID="your-business-account-id"
   WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-whatsapp-access-token"
   ```

   **Important**: Keep sensitive information like API keys and tokens secure and never commit them to version control.

4. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   bun db:migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Database Connection Issues

**Local SQLite Setup:**

- Ensure `DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"` in your `.env` file
- Leave `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` empty or remove it entirely
- Run `bun db:migrate` to create the database file

**Turso/LibSQL Setup:**

- Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` starts with `libsql://`
- Provide a valid `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` from your Turso dashboard
- Verify your Turso database is accessible and the token has proper permissions

**Common Errors:**

- `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`: Check file permissions and path for local SQLite
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Verify your Turso auth token is correct and not expired
- `CONNECTION_FAILED`: Check network connectivity for remote databases

## Development Commands

### Development

```bash
bun dev          # Start development server with Turbo
bun build        # Build for production
bun start        # Start production server
bun preview      # Build and start production server
```

### Database

```bash
bun db:generate  # Generate database migrations
bun db:migrate   # Run database migrations
bun db:push      # Push schema changes directly
bun db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio
