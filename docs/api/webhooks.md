# Webhooks

BookMe supports webhooks to notify external systems about important events in real-time.

## Overview

Webhooks are HTTP POST requests sent to your specified endpoint URL when certain events occur. This allows you to integrate BookMe with your existing systems, CRM, or custom applications.

## Configuration

Webhooks can be configured in the business dashboard under Settings > Integrations > Webhooks.

### Webhook Settings

- **Endpoint URL**: Your HTTPS endpoint that will receive webhook events
- **Secret Key**: Used to verify webhook authenticity (recommended)
- **Events**: Select which events to receive
- **Retry Policy**: Configure retry attempts for failed deliveries

## Security

### Signature Verification

Each webhook includes a signature header for verification:

```
X-BookMe-Signature: sha256=<signature>
```

Verify the signature using your secret key:

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(payload, "utf8")
    .digest("hex");

  return `sha256=${expectedSignature}` === signature;
}
```

### IP Allowlist

Webhook requests come from these IP ranges:

- `192.168.1.0/24` (development)
- `10.0.0.0/8` (production)

## Delivery and Retries

### Delivery Expectations

- Webhooks are delivered within 30 seconds of the event
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Expected response: HTTP 2xx status code
- Content-Type: `application/json`

### Retry Policy

Failed webhook deliveries are retried with exponential backoff:

1. Immediate retry
2. 1 minute later
3. 5 minutes later
4. 15 minutes later
5. 1 hour later
6. 6 hours later
7. 24 hours later

After 7 failed attempts, the webhook is marked as failed and no further retries are attempted.

### Failure Reasons

- HTTP status code >= 400
- Connection timeout (30 seconds)
- DNS resolution failure
- SSL certificate errors

## Testing Webhooks

### Webhook Testing Tool

Use the webhook testing tool in your dashboard to:

- Send test events to your endpoint
- View delivery logs and responses
- Debug webhook issues

### Example Test Event

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-endpoint.com/webhooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-BookMe-Signature: sha256=test_signature" \
  -d '{
    "event": "booking.created",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-31T15:30:00Z",
    "data": {
      "appointment": {
        "id": "apt_test",
        "confirmationNumber": "TEST123",
        "status": "pending"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Endpoint Implementation

1. **Respond quickly**: Return HTTP 200 within 30 seconds
2. **Process asynchronously**: Queue webhook processing for complex operations
3. **Verify signatures**: Always verify webhook authenticity
4. **Handle duplicates**: Implement idempotency using event IDs
5. **Log events**: Keep logs for debugging and audit purposes

### Error Handling

```javascript
app.post("/webhooks/bookme", (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Verify signature
    if (!verifyWebhook(req.body, req.headers["x-bookme-signature"], secret)) {
      return res.status(401).send("Invalid signature");
    }

    // Process webhook asynchronously
    processWebhookAsync(req.body);

    // Respond immediately
    res.status(200).send("OK");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Webhook error:", error);
    res.status(500).send("Internal error");
  }
});
```

### Monitoring

- Monitor webhook delivery success rates
- Set up alerts for high failure rates
- Track processing times and errors
- Implement health checks for your webhook endpoint
